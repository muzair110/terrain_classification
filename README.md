# Terrain Types Classification

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning solution for classifying terrain types from images. Using PyTorch and transfer learning with ResNet50, the model accurately identifies four distinct terrain categories: desert, forest, mountain, and plains.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the [Different Terrain Types Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/durgeshrao9993/different-terrain-types-classification) dataset from Kaggle, containing balanced samples of four terrain categories.

## Results

### Training and Validation Metrics

The training curves demonstrate:
- Rapid convergence within the first 5 epochs
- Final training accuracy of ~99.5%
- Final validation accuracy of ~98.7%
- Stable performance with minimal overfitting

### Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix shows excellent classification performance:
- Desert: 119/120 correctly classified (99.2% accuracy)
- Forest: 118/119 correctly classified (99.2% accuracy)
- Mountain: 119/120 correctly classified (99.2% accuracy)
- Plains: 120/120 correctly classified (100% accuracy)
